# Statistical-Analysis-of-Gene-Expression-to-Differentiate-Invasive-and-Noninvasive-Cancer-Using-R
This project involves the statistical analysis of gene expression data to investigate differences between invasive and noninvasive cancer types using R. Each student receives an individual subset of 10 genes from the dataset gene-expression-invasive-vs-noninvasive-cancer.csv, selected based on their registration number. The analysis begins with the computation of variance, covariance, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between gene variables. Distance matrices are then calculated to assess the similarity between gene expression profiles. The project continues with the creation of univariate Q-Q plots and a multivariate Q-Q plot using generalized distances to evaluate normality assumptions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce dimensionality and identify key patterns within the gene data. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) is conducted to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in gene expression between invasive and noninvasive cancer groups, which requires incorporating a class label into the dataset. Additionally, the first and second principal components are used to visualize potential separation between the two cancer types. The project also includes applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classification, with performance metrics such as a confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, and misclassification error calculated to assess model accuracy. All results are to be clearly presented in a concise report containing up to 10 figures and 10 tables, supported by thorough explanation. The corresponding R code must be submitted separately and should include clear comments for reproducibility. This assignment provides practical experience in multivariate statistical techniques with real-world applications in biomedical research.
